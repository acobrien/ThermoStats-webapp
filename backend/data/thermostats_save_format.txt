For Cool mode: .0591kwh/m
For Heat mode: pretend the same: .0591kwh/m
For Airwave mode: .0071lkwh/m

Electric cost (with all taxes): $0.152/kwh

On 4/20, the West Side ran in Cool mode for 129m at 0.0591kwh/m = 7.624kwh x $0.152 = $1.16
On 4/20, the West Side ran in Airwave mode for 120m at 0.0071kwh/m = 0.852kwh x $0.152 = $0.13

On 4/20, the East Side ran in Cool mode for 269m at 0.0591kwh/m = 15.898kwh x $0.152 = $2.42
On 4/20, the East Side ran in Airwave mode for 296m at 0.0071kwh/m = 2.1kwh x $0.152 = $0.32
